        <h3>Chickens</h3>
        <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated fowl,
            originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird. A younger male may be
            called a cockerel; a male that has been castrated is a capon. The adult female bird is called a hen.
            "Chicken"
            was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird, but thanks to its usage on restaurant
            menus
            has now become the most common term for the subspecies in general, especially in American English. In older
            sources common fowl or domestic fowl were typically used for this.</p>
